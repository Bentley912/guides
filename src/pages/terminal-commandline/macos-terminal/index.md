# Using the Terminal in Mac OS

Most of the time users interact through a Graphical User Interface to interact with the computer. You use the mouse to point and click to open, move, or create new files or open applications. But, you can also use the Terminal Application to interact with your machine through written commands. When you use the terminal, it allows you to dig deeper and customize in a way not possible through the GUI. 

### Opening the Terminal and Navigating Directories
Your terminal exists in the Applications directory. Open your Terminal app. You should see a prompt in the terminal window. it shoudl have the computer's name (ABC's Macbook), followed by the User name (ABC), and then a '$.' If you are in the root directory, the last character will be a '#.'

To see what directory you are working in, just type the command 

```pwd```

pwd stands for "Print Working Directory." Directory is another word for folder. 

If you want to list the contents of your directory use the command: 

```ls```

To switch from to a new directory you use the command 

```cd``

which stand for change directory.
